## Commit Details

- **Author**: Keunwoo Choi <gnuchoi+github@gmail.com>
- **Message**: Add database validation step before export in workflows

Fail-fast check to prevent cryptic errors from empty database:
- Check event and venue counts before running export script
- Exit with clear error message if database is empty
- Show helpful command to fix the issue
- Display counts when validation passes

This prevents the confusing 'no such table: events' error from
propagating through the export script. Now both test and production
deployments will fail immediately with actionable error messages.

Fixes the root cause of the empty database deployment failure.

## Deployment

- **Live Site**: https://seoulunderground.live
